Interface
1.	Create serialized routines (scenarios) for deployment on target hardware

2.	Allow creation of custom hardware commands including:
•	Audible questions, feedback and context description
•	Display Braille characters on specialized hardware
•	Repeat, skip and branch routine lifecycle
•	Wait for user input and continue once received
•	Play back local audio files
•	Restart or reset routines
•	Manipulate and control braille cells accessible to the user

3.	Provide adequate accessibility support for visually impaired users through included support for screen readers such as NVDA, Jaws, Apply Voice Over.

4.	Modify, refine and adjust existing routines through a clean and robust editor UI experience

5.	Provide suitable access to prototype, test and observe created routines on fully simulated hardware. 


Use Cases
1.	Provide a flexible medium for educators of Braille to build intricate hardware routines that can be used to teach illiterate students through entertaining games, telltale stories and engaging experiences.
2.	Use as a platform to enhance existing methods of teaching Braille to illiterates and younger audiences.
3.	Use as an interactive medium for story telling and to engage in constructive discussions.
